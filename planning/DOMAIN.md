# Domain Model and Meeting Context

## Product Context
Meeting Tool by LyArk is a lightweight operational leadership meeting tool. It is influenced by The Table Group / The Advantage tactical meeting model and is intended to help leadership teams run structured weekly meetings without becoming a heavy project management system.

## Key Terms
| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Top Priority / Thematic Goal | The current short-term rallying priority for the leadership team. |
| Defining Objectives | Temporary qualitative components that help describe and accomplish the Top Priority / Thematic Goal. |
| Standard Operating Objectives | Ongoing priorities and operating standards that continue beyond the current Top Priority. |
| Strategic Topics | Persistent strategic holding items that should not be resolved during tactical meetings. |
| Tactical Meeting | A recurring operating meeting focused on near-term priorities, blockers, commitments, and communication. |
| Cascading Communication | The information staff or direct reports need to know after the leadership meeting. |

## Current Meeting Flow
1. Review Playbook Definitions and current organizational context as needed.
2. Align around the Top Priority / Thematic Goal.
3. Review Defining Objectives and associated tasks.
4. Track tasks through `Planning → In Progress → Completed`.
5. Capture Agenda Items, Strategic Topics, Decisions / Actions, and Cascading Communication in meeting sections.
6. Preserve workspace data through browser storage and JSON backup exports.

## Intended User Roles
- Project owner: sets product direction, prioritizes work, and validates meeting usefulness.
- Leadership team member: uses the live app during meetings to review priorities, tasks, and communication.
- Future builder/Codex: implements scoped changes after reading the planning source of truth.

## Assumptions
- Phase 1 usage is single-browser/local workspace usage.
- Shared collaboration, auth, and role enforcement are Phase 2 concerns and are not yet implemented.
